    <h1> What percentage of beds in homeless shelters were reserved for youth during the pandemic? </h1>
        <p> This project explores this question using U.S. Housing and Urban Development data with Salesforce Tableau </p>
        <p> Inquiry: Selected HUD homeless shelter datasets to discover patterns in pandemic-era homeless youth migration.</p> 
        <p> Added Tableau dimension filters and created calculated fields to hand-pick, clean and organize key total percent youth bed data points for analysis.
            In the final Tableau dashboard, instituted a tri-color legend for bubble charts, ascending scatterplots, and column charts to show changes in percent of available beds for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020.</p>
        <p> Determined that the Covid-19 pandemic created significant changes in available beds for transitional homeless youth in shelters in the U.S. and New York from 2019-2020.</p>
        <p> Analysis: Determined that the Covid-19 pandemic created significant changes in available beds for transitional homeless youth in shelters in the U.S. and New York from 2019-2020.
 </p>
        <p> Recommendation: Review the implications of nationwide homeless youth migration patterns as they affect the changing quantity of housing resources needed in each U.S. state.
